Quarters allows the sub-division, sale, and ownership of Towny plots by players using a wand or a series of user-friendly commands. The most common use-case for this is making so-called "apartments" in plots that could otherwise only be owned by one player.

The wand item is flint by default, this can be used to select two corners that form a rectangular cuboid area that can be turned into a "quarter" (as in "living quarters") by a player using `/q create`. The gravel also makes a handy tool to covertly scratch your tenant's floors to ensure you keep the security deposit.

While a player is selecting an area a particle outline will be displayed showing the selected area if they are currently holding the wand item. Quarters are limited to be within a singular town block to avoid some liability of bugs that may occur from quarters that span multiple town blocks.
