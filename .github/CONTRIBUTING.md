# Contribution guide

If your pull request is a minor change such as:

- A spelling correction
- A hotfix or patch
- A small useful feature that does not affect pre-existing functionality

Feel free to simply open a pull request and it will be reviewed. However, if you are unsure that it is a wanted change you can check beforehand with a maintainer.

If your pull request is a major change such as:

- Altering the intended behaviour of a pre-existing feature
- A large, new feature that may not be wanted by the maintainers
- An API breaking change

You *should* contact a maintainer (Fruitloopins) in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ey6ZvnwAJp) or open a discussion in the Quarters repository before starting work on it. If you do not do this, you should not be surprised if your PR is rejected for being an unwanted change.
